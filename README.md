# Calculator

This calculator can perform the following operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^)
- Square root (√)
- Factorial (!)
- Sine (sin)
- Cosine (cos)
- Tangent (tan)

The calculator can also handle scientific notation.

## Examples of how to use the calculator:
- To add 2 and 3, enter `2+3`.
- To subtract 5 from 10, enter `10-5`.
- To multiply 4 by 6, enter `4*6`.
- To divide 12 by 3, enter `12/3`.
- To square 4, enter `4^2`.
- To find the square root of 16, enter `√(16)`.
- To calculate the factorial of 5, enter `5!`.
- For the sine of an angle 25 in a right-angled triangle, enter `sin(25).`
- For the cosine of an angle 30, enter `cos(30)`.
- For the tangent of an angle 35, enter `tan(35)`.
  
The calculator automatically converts scientific notation to decimal notation when calculating results.

## Examples of how to use scientific notation with the calculator:
- To enter 6.022 x 10^23, enter `6.022e23`.
- To enter 2.718 x 10^-5, enter `2.718e-5`.

The calculator will also display results in scientific notation if the result is very large or very small.

## Usage:
- Use `CalculatorActivity.calculate(x)` to perform a calculation.
- Replace `x` with the math problem. The problem must be specified in a string and can contain more than two different or identical numbers or operators.
